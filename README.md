Coffee Machine Simulator with Java

This simulator lets you interact with a virtual barista that makes espresso, cappuccino, and latte, all from your command line.

Built as part of the JetBrains Academy’s Java track, this project recreates a coffee vending machine experience using object-oriented programming concepts.

## 💡 What It Does ##

This coffee machine:
Offers three types of drinks: espresso, latte, cappuccino
Tracks ingredient inventory: water, milk, coffee beans, and cups

Allows you to:

🛒 Buy coffee  
🔄 Refill supplies  
💰 Take out collected money  
📦 Check remaining stock  
🧼 Clean the machine (after enough usage)  

All from a simple text-based menu.
